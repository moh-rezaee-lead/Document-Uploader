# Document Uploader For Flutter Android

This plugin allows Flutter apps to launch arbitrary intents when the platform
is Android. This intent only load content of selected file in android. If the plugin is invoked on iOS, it will crash your app. In checked
mode, we assert that the platform should be Android.
